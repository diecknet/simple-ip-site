## About this project

This is a simple serverside/serverless JavaScript website to plainly present the IP-Address of the visitor. It's made specifically to work on [Cloudflare Workers Sites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/sites). The website itself doesn't need JavaScript to be enabled on the client. But having clientside JavaScript enabled adds an easy "Copy to Clipboard" function. The site is styled with pure CSS, using [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp).

## About the code

The source code consists of 2 main folders:
- [public/](/public/) - contains the mostly static portions aka "**the site**"
- [workers-site/](/workers-site/) - contains the JavaScript application as **[index.js](/workers-site/index.js)**

### Getting the visitor's IP Address with Cloudflare Workers

The magic is happening in `getClientIPInfo(request)`. Cloudflare is providing informations like visitor IP-Address and location and we can easily use it.

```javascript
// get country from cloudflare
let location = (request.cf || {}).country
    // if we know which city, prepend to location
    if((request.cf || {}).city) {
        location = ((request.cf || {}).city)+', '+location
    }
// [...]
/* get client ip address by Cloudflare header 'CF-Connecting-IP' */
      ipaddress: request.headers.get('CF-Connecting-IP')
```
